##
#
#
# all communications use the following method:
#
# client will set values into a redis List with key made from "keyprefix:mykeystring"
#
# The values in this list will be [device, propertyname, timestamp, elementstring1, elementstring2, ....]
# These act as the arguments to a command to be sent to indiserver.
# The first three items must always exist, but could be empty strings depending on the
# command to be sent. The following strings will be further redis keys which point to hashes representing
# the elements of the property to be set. The actual values 'mykeystring', 'elementstring1'... etc are
# arbitrary strings chosen by the client.
#
# client will then publish, on channel <to_indi_channel>, the message "<commandname>:<mykeystring>"
#
# The indiredis package subscribes to the <to_indi_channel>, and will then lookup the "keyprefix:mykeystring" list,
# and interpret it as in the following examples.

# If the command is getProperties, the indiredis package will always inset the indi Protocol Version 1.7 into
# the command, and so this value is not needed.

# publish message:   'getProperties:mykeystring'
# using list key "keyprefix:mykeystring" and value ["","",""]
# this is the  getProperties command, with no device specified, and therefore is a request for all device properties.
#                   
#
# NOTE: the indiredis package will delete the key and contents, once having read it.
#
#
# publish message:   'newTextVector:mykeystring'
# using list key "keyprefix:mykeystring" and list value [<devicename,<propertyname>,"",anotherkeystring, yetanotherkeystring]
#
# In this case no timestamp is given, so indiredis will insert one. Then indiredis will look up the two keys given
#
# key "keyprefix:anotherkeystring" should contain a hash table.
# similarly key "keyprefix:yetanotherkeystring" should contain a hash table.
#
# In this case, each hash table will correspond to the oneText element and be of the form:
# {name:<elementname>, value:<elementvalue>}
#
# generally the hash table will give the attributes of the element, with the attribute 'value' being set as the element's value.
#
# There is one exception to this rule. The enableBLOB command does not include any elements, but only one string of Never|Also|Only
# So the list for the enableBLOB command will be of the form:
#
#  [<devicename,<propertyname>,"",<Never|Also|Only>]
#
# If propertyname is "", this command applies to all properties of the device.
